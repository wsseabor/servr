#Servr

##The app that helps service industry professionals track tips on their desktops

##Motivation

> Though there are a few tip tracking applications on the app store, users do have to 
go through a torrent of ad services to even engage with the app itself (even 
app freelancers need cash too). This is designed to be a desktop application that is
ad free and has the funcitonality to do what you need - namely track the tips according
to date, with notes of each date if that applies. Graphing functionality is also 
included, if visualization is more your speed.

##Requirements
> Python3
  Matplotlib

##Installation

> Python is already installed on most machines nowadays, but in case not:
[Download python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

```
pip install matplotlib
```
